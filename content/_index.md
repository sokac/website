Hi there! I'm a software engineer living in San Francisco.

I grew up in Vinkovci, a small town in Croatia. I started to
tinkering with computers early in my life. I was very fascinated by how they
work work and their vast possibilities. I learned
[Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) programming
language at I.G.  Kovacica Elementary School and attended a few national
competitions (which, to my surprise, are still active!). Then, I did some web
development (good ol' LAMP stack), mostly for local business, personal
projects, and community projects.
[blogeri.hr](https://blogeri.hr), a blog aggregator, won an award for the best
Croatian website in the Media and News category in 2016 and
[linuxzasve.com](https://linuxzasve.com), a Linux community website, won an
award in 2009 for the best website in the Science and Education category.

I moved to Palo Alto for work when I was 21. I ended up going back to Croatia a
year later to finish my education and get a B.S. (and a M.S. later). I was lucky
enough to get a US work visa (H1B) at age 24 and I've lived in San Francisco
since.

Fast forward to today (2025), I'm a Croatian-American and a father of two daughters.
I still work in tech.

## Hobbies

I work as a software engineer but I still like to write code as a hobby too
(can it be called a hobby then?). Although, not as much as I used to. I also
enjoy working with hardware - from building a PC to doing personal IoT
projects, as well as playing casual chess. In general, I like to learn new
things - from personal finance, blockchain, LLM / Gen AI to 3D printing,
woodworking, BBQ and so much more.

These days, I spend most of my personal time with my two young kids and wife.
