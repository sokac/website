Hi there! I'm a software engineer living in San Francisco.

I grew up in Vinkovci, a small town in Croatia. I don't recall exactly when I
got my first computer, but I sure was under 10. I was fascinated by how it
works and its endless possibilities. I learned
[Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) programming
language in I.G.  Kovacica elementary school and attended a few national
competitions (which, to my surprise, is still active!). I started doing more web
development (good ol' LAMP stack) when I started high school, mostly for local
business, personal projects and community projects, such as
[blogeri.hr](https://blogeri.hr) (won an award for the best Croatian website in
Media and News category in 2016) and [linuxzasve.com](https://linuxzasve.com).

At age 21, I moved to Palo Alto for work. I ended up going back to Croatia a
year later to finish my education and get B.S. (and M.S later). I was lucky
enough to get a US work visa (H1B) at age 24 and I've lived in San Francisco
since.

Fast forward to today (2024), I'm a father of two daughters, and a dual
citizen. I still work in tech.

## Hobbies

I work as a software engineer but I still like to write code as a hobby too
(can it be called a hobby then?). Although, not as much as I used to. I also
enjoy working with hardware too - from building a PC to doing personal IoT
projects, as well as playing casual chess. In general, I like to learn new
things - from personal finance, blockchain, LLM / Gen AI to 3D printing,
woodworking, BBQ and so much more.

These days, I spend most of my personal time with my two young kids and wife.
