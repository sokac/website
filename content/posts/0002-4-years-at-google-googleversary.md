4 years ago on this day I joined Google (fun fact: I joined Google on Tuesday,
while most people join on Monday). It has been a very unique, interesting
experience.

I joined Chrome Operations Source team - a team that is  responsiblefor
providing [a set of
tools](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/tools/depot_tools) to work
with the Chromium codebase (fetching codebase, uploading changes for review,
among many other things), providing tools to browse codebase -
[codesearch](https://source.chromium.org) (we heavily rely on many internal
teams) and manage [Chromium Gerrit](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com).

This was a shift from my previous experiences - while I did have a fair amount
of knowledge in VCS and code review systems, it was never my primary focus.
Instead, I worked on distributed backend systems and SRE/DevOps like work.

My first starter project was to provide "View blame prior to this
change" in [Chromium Codesearch](https://source.chromium.org). The change
applied to all Codesearch instances, not just Chromium's. With that, I got
familiar with a few internal systems, Google's best practices, and met ICs I'd
continue to work with. I also got to refresh my Typescript and Java knowledge,
both languages I hadn't used in a while. What a great starter project!

Lots of things have happened since. Two months in, the COVID-19 lockdown
started and fundamentally changed everything - how we all work together and
what do we focus on. There were many interesting projects and new faces. In
2022, I also had my second kid and I took 18 weeks of parental leave - this is
one of the best benefits that Google gives.

Unfortunately, Google had msasive layoffs in 2023, and continues with layoffs in
2024. I believe that impacted the culture of the company, but so did work from
home and return to office that followed after. I feel the culture will continue
to evolve - and time will tell how that turns out.

Last 4 years were an interesting "rollercoaster ride"! What I like at Google is
predictable projects, a good work-life balance, great benefits and perks,
working with many talented people and seeing first hand how a big company
operates. On the flip side, things are moving much slower than start-ups, as I
kind of anticipated. There are a lot more people and teams involved. Being
a global company, we have to deal with time zone differences.

All in all, I strongly believe joining Google was a good decision. I learned a
lot of soft skills - about team leadership and how to be a good technical
lead, how to communicate better (internally and externally. And I learned a ton
of technical stuff too, from Git to distributed build systems. For now, I'm not
going anywhere.
