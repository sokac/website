San Francisco, The City by the Bay, has unique architectural and cultural
identify. It's famous for its bridges to old victorian houses, but also for
being a leading city in tech (most recently, in AI). However, one thing that
I noticed when I moved here over 10 years ago is that its infrastructure is
lagging behind other big cities, at least in Europe. For example, back in 2014,
there was very limited fiber optics infrastucture, but things look much better
today (although, I'm still stuck with cable internet). But what is even more
fascinating to me is amount of utility poles in San Francisco, especially
near the Sunset district. Let's take a look at the current state
([source](https://sfpublicworks.org/services/utility-undergrounding-information)):

So, you may wonder how does that look today? Let's take a look:

What else to say then: so ugly it's beautiful. There's a fair amount of Reddit posts
about this too:, e.g.
[pretty in their own way](https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1cv2m3w/some_folks_dont_like_the_power_lines_but_i_think/), 
or
[aging utility pole replacement](https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/m57iqx/pge_replaced_the_aging_utility_pole_in_front_of/).
Some even make nice artwork too:

and

San Francisco started utility undergrounding back in 1960s, and with another
push in 1990s. The undergrounding projects are expensive and complex, and also
increase the maintenance cost resulting in stalled projects. But, there is a
new push to burry the utilities. So, maybe San Francisco will no longer have
ugly-beautiful poles in the next decade but I wouldn't bet on it.
